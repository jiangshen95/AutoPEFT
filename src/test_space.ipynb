year . . . . watching it was painful .', \"gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .\", 'by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best .', \"it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space .\", \"burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .\", 'lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .', \"a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .\", 'you can practically hear george orwell turning over .', 'the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .', 'a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .', \"as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits .\", 'insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .', 'the whole talking-animal thing is grisly .', \". . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .\", \"what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish .\", 'as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .', 'smarter than its commercials make it seem .', \"there's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what's nice is that there's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .\", \"if you're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you .\", \"ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem .\", 'i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .', 'a breathtaking adventure for all ages , spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images .', 'girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy .', 'has none of the crackle of \" fatal attraction \" , \" 9 ½ weeks \" , or even \" indecent proposal \" , and feels more like lyne\\'s stolid remake of \" lolita \" .', \"the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .\", 'too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured .', 'saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion .', \"it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .\", \"slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .\", \"with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative .\", 'hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .', \"the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine .
